Towards the end of my senior year in high school I got really into mechanical keyboard videos on Youtube. I was so into it, actually, that I bought parts to custom build my own keyboard and then realised I didn't have a PC or a computer yet :0

This is my PSA that the build I went with is super meh, old hand-me-down GPU + the cheapest working parts I could put together + a really cute water cooler, but it still works! I told my dad, an engineer, that I was going to build it all alone and even though it took me all day, I finished it by myself eventually.

The hardest part about this process that I can remember is not being able to thermal paste on the water cooler piece correctly, but other than that, and watching tutorials for installing and troubleshooting every single part, I was surprised and proud of myself for finishing this project alone! Hopefully sometime in the future I can update the parts (I already upgraded the GPU so I could run COD :3) and improve on the build even more.
