<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The problem: UH Manoa has multiple programs for study abroad and exchange opportunities, <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/mix/">Manoa International Exchange (MIX)</a>, <a href="https://www.studyabroad.hawaii.edu/">Study Abroad Center</a>, and <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/nse/home/">National Student Exchange</a>. However, these programs are all separate entities and it can be hard to not only find which of the three would fit a students needs and wants, but also find information and first hand experiences with each of the programs all in one place. Maybe you want to compare the programs, look at the pros and cons of each, and read about which countries and schools interest you the most. It can be annoying and time consuming to navigate through 3 pages where this kind of information can be buried and difficult to find.</p>

<p>The solution: So, our solution is to provide a go-to source for students to read about first hand experiences from students who already participated in one or more of the programs and can take advantage of being able to communicate with them directly. This app will allow students to:
*Post about their own study abroad and exchange experiences
*Comment on other students posts
*Look through country specific posts</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>The main page of this website will be presenting the blog posts of exchange and study abroad students.</p>

<p>Two roles should be enough, a user role assigned to the students chatting and posting on the website, and an admin role to handle any issues that may arise.</p>

<p>Mockup page ideas:</p>

<p>*Landing page</p>

<p>*Login/Sign up page</p>

<p>*Choose country/region</p>

<p>*Post feed page with comment ability</p>

<p>*Add post page</p>

<p>*Admin home page</p>

<p>*Admin all posts page</p>

<h2 id="case-ideas">Case Ideas</h2>

<p>*New user (who has done study abroad or exchange) creates an account and signs up, chooses the region they studied in, looks through posts existing, creates a post about their experience, responds to other posts or comments</p>

<p>*New user (who has not done study abroad or exchange) creates an account and signs up, chooses the region they want to study in, looks through posts, comments questions they have</p>

<p>*Admin logs in, looks through every post regardless of country/region, edits or deletes inappropriate posts</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-basics">Beyond the Basics</h2>
<p>Some more advanced features could be:
	*Notifying students when a post about a country they are interested in is made
	*Having a Google map location associated with posts and their schools
	*A “like” button on posts
	*Notifications when a post or comment is replied to</p>
